          <h4>1. Expect the Unexpected</h4>
            <p>Traveling is a memorable and enjoyable experience, but there are often unforeseen hiccups along the way. 
              But you may become a well-prepared traveler by constantly putting yourself 
              at least one step ahead of the unexpected.</p>

        <div class="col">
          <h4>2. Less is More</h4>
            <p>Travel light, travel well. You never need everything you think you do, 
              and you can always get what you need in another city or country.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h4>3. Eat Well Sleep Well</h4>
            <p>This is the most straighforward and applicable advice. Theres is no need for an explanation. 
              <br>Follow the words!</p>

          <h4>4. Patience is a Virtue</h4>
            <p>The more you travel, the more you will realize how many travel-related activities demand patience. 
              Attractions, shopping places, airports, and many other areas all have lines. 
              Transportation delays, malfunctioning machinery, security checks, and a host of other issues will all occur.
              You will discover, though, that being impatient in many of these circumstances has no positive effect. 
              Even in certain cases, being impatient will just make matters worse, 
              thus always remember to be patient while traveling

          <h4>5. Donâ€™t Be a Tourist 
            <br>Be a Traveler
          </h4>
            <p>Please take the time to prepare and move beyond travel guidebooks.
              To gather information prior to a trip and ensure you will not be missing anything important, 
              researching attractions and reading the greatest travel advice is undeniably crucial. 
              What about doing a different kind of research? Like watching a classic film that was shot in that location and reading a novel with a setting there? 
              I personally enjoy imagining the place I am about to visit in my head using its art and culture. 
              It is such a fascinating and rich approach to learn about the various underlying facets of a foreign country and its culture.

          <h4>6. Travel by Yourself at least Once 
            <br>in Your Lifetime</h4>
            <p>Traveling solo is always so much more fun than you anticipated.
              You genuinely learn more about yourself when you travel alone. When you are all on your own,
              it is easier to be intimidated by the unfamiliar surroundings, but you will grow faster and become more responsible.
